# NumPy (Numerical) Python

NumPy (Numeric Python) is one of the most important libraries and is often used in the Python programming language for numerical computing. It is a powerful tool for working with numerical arrays and matrices, as well as providing various functions for numerical data processing.

Here are some important features about NumPy in Python:

â€¢ NumPy: NumPy array introduces numpy.ndarray data type, which is an efficient multidimensional array. This means you can create one-dimensional arrays (vectors), two-dimensional arrays (matrices), and even arrays with more dimensions.

â€¢ NumPy provides a variety of efficient mathematical operations for arrays, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more. It also includes linear operations of algebra, statistics, and other mathematical functions.

â€¢ Indexing and Slicing: You can easily access elements in NumPy arrays using indexing and slicing, which allows flexible data manipulation.

â€¢ NumPy is an active open source project. The library has a large and diverse community that contributes to the development and maintenance of the library.

# Pandas

Pandas is a Python library used for data analysis, data manipulation, and tabular data processing. It is very popular in the data science and data analysis community because it provides a powerful and efficient tool for working with structured data.

The following are some of the main features of Pandas:

â€¢ DataFrame: DataFrame is the core data structure in Pandas. This is a two-dimensional table similar to a spreadsheet or table in a database. DataFrame allows you to store, index, and manage data in a structured format.

â€¢ Series is a one-dimensional data structure in Pandas. This is similar to the columns in DataFrame and is used to store one type of data in bulk.

â€¢ Data Manipulation: You can perform various data manipulation operations such as filtering, indexing, merging, sorting, grouping, and data transformation.

# loc and iloc

â€¢ loc (Label-based indexing)
loc is used to access data by label or row and column name.
You access elements or parts of DataFrame by referring to line and column label names.

â€¢ iloc (Integer-based indexing)
iloc is used to access data by position index, starting at 0.
You access elements or parts of DataFrame by referring to indexes by order of rows and columns.

# Dictionary 

A Python dictionary is a data structure used to store associated key pairs (keys) A dictionary is part of a data type called mapping or associative array. The main feature of the dictionary is its ability to organize, store, and access data in an efficient manner.

# DataFrame 

DataFrame in Python is a highly flexible two-dimensional data structure used to store and manage data in a table similar to a spreadsheet or database. DataFrame consists of rows and columns, where each column can contain different types of data (e.g., numbers, text, dates) and have its own label. Data Frames is a powerful tool for importing, processing, analyzing, and modifying data in a variety of formats, including CSV, Excel, SQL, and many others.


# Processing Titanic Analysis Data

This data is used as a case study in data analysis as it provides varied information about the survivors and survivors of the first tragic voyage.


Major points analyzed in the Titanic dataset include:

â€¢ Survival: one of the most important points in survival analysis. How is the distribution of survival and non-availability among passengers, whether there are certain factors affecting survival rates, such as cabin class, gender, age, and so on.

â€¢ Passengers classification: Titanic data includes information about cabin class (Pclass), sex (Sex), and age (Age) of passengers. to see how the survival distribution is based on this data.

â€¢ Family Data (SibSp and Parch): SibSp variables (number of siblings or spouses on board) and Parch (number of parents or children on board) used to analyze how family presence affects survival rates.

â€¢ Ticket Fee (Fare): Ticket fee is used as an indicator of the passenger's social status and the average ticket reservation by class.

â€¢ Missing Data: searching for missing or incomplete data (missing values) in the dataset.


# Python Mini Project Adaptation

The goal of learning Python Mini Project Adaptation is to provide participants with practical experience to apply knowledge and skills learned in Python programming languages.






ðŸ™Œ"The third week of learning Python has brought more knowledge, experience, and confidence. We are currently focusing on a deeper understanding of the basic concepts of Python, as well as its application to data analysis. Although we sometimes face obstacles, we realize that that's part of the learning process. We feel lucky to have supportive group friends, and mentors who are always ready to guide us. Thank you for your support and encouragement during this trip!"ðŸš€
