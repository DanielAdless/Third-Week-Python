# NumPy (Numerical) Python

NumPy (Numeric Python) is one of the most important libraries and is often used in the Python programming language for numerical computing. It is a powerful tool for working with numerical arrays and matrices, as well as providing various functions for numerical data processing.

Here are some important features about NumPy in Python:

• NumPy: NumPy array introduces numpy.ndarray data type, which is an efficient multidimensional array. This means you can create one-dimensional arrays (vectors), two-dimensional arrays (matrices), and even arrays with more dimensions.

• NumPy provides a variety of efficient mathematical operations for arrays, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more. It also includes linear operations of algebra, statistics, and other mathematical functions.

• Indexing and Slicing: You can easily access elements in NumPy arrays using indexing and slicing, which allows flexible data manipulation.

• NumPy is an active open source project. The library has a large and diverse community that contributes to the development and maintenance of the library.

# Pandas

Pandas is a Python library used for data analysis, data manipulation, and tabular data processing. It is very popular in the data science and data analysis community because it provides a powerful and efficient tool for working with structured data.

The following are some of the main features of Pandas:

• DataFrame: DataFrame is the core data structure in Pandas. This is a two-dimensional table similar to a spreadsheet or table in a database. DataFrame allows you to store, index, and manage data in a structured format.

• Series is a one-dimensional data structure in Pandas. This is similar to the columns in DataFrame and is used to store one type of data in bulk.

• Data Manipulation: You can perform various data manipulation operations such as filtering, indexing, merging, sorting, grouping, and data transformation.
